# HACK-AT-UCI-2023

Please download ALL files into a folder and import it to the Godot Engine (which can be downloaded through https://godotengine.org/).

Alternatively, you can download a zip file of the game from our releases (https://github.com/munizaa/HACK-AT-UCI-2023/releases/tag/v1.0.1). Extract all files and run the Petr.Run.exe file (make sure that the .pck file is in there).

Petr Run starts by allowing users to read instructions, start a game, or quit the program. 

If instructions are pressed, they are given the opportunity to do a tutorial to get comfortable with the control keys (A/D or arrow keys for left and right; Space Bar or Up Arrow Key for jump) and try to get to the Spider Petr (the Petr hosting the Petr drop) to collect their sticker.

Once done, the user can start a game by pressing Start. 

Users are notified of where the Petr drop will occur and shown a campus map. They are prompted to click on any area of the map which takes them to a zoomed-in map so they are aware of where theyâ€™ve clicked. Once a user has chosen to proceed to that area of campus, a one-minute timer counts down. In a specified location in that area (of 4 total locations), they must avoid zotbots so as to not lose health (where a sum of three contacts causes the user to lose) and reach where the Spider Petr is. 

If Spider Petr is not in the selected location, users can navigate to another side of campus by moving toward the sides of the screen. As the UCI campus is round, the locations can be entered multiple times if the user keeps moving in one direction. When the user spots Petr, they should try their best to come into contact with them before the time runs out. 

Regardless of if they are able to get a sticker or not, users are given the option to play again.
